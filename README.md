## Introduction
This project was created for Hack The North 2021 by Mabel Luo, Tabitha Wong and Anthony Maocheia-Ricci.

We know that mornings set the mood for the rest of the day. When the world was sent into a whirlwind of uncertainty with Covid-19, we knew we wanted to create an app that empowers users to have confidence from the moment they wake up. 

That's when (more)ning comes in. With a sleek and easy UI, it gives the user the choice to get a preview of their day without feeling overwhelmed.
